Lalitamba, my great mother  
In every atom, every speck of dust
Every leaf, every bird,
Every thought, every feeling,
Every step, every breath
Every sigh, every celebration
Every joy, every sorrow
May I only see you.

May your mantra fuse with my breath
May your yantra fuse with my body
May I melt away in your light
May my love for you be so deep
That within me I can not keep.

Enough my mother!
You have tested me enough!
Take your son in your arms.
